 The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Michelson Interferometer</SPAN> is a basic amplitude-splitting interferometry technique which is seldom used on its own for instrumentation purposes.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Hecht1987">15</A>, p.&nbsp;387] However, it is well studied and serves as a model on top of which other features may be added.

This implementation is still not exactly correct in theory, but after a little calibration,  This will result in a fringe pattern at <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Detector</SPAN>, the nulls of which are fairly close to:

If instead, we use a monochromatic source, the interference between two parallel mirrors <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="67" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img190.png"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 HREF="node33.html#Hecht1987">15</A>, p.&nbsp;390]

<P>
If we replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img364.png"
 ALT="$M_1$"></SPAN> with an arbitrary surface, we could use this as a rangefinder. It turns out that for some applications, this sort of topology works well.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Hecht1987">15</A>, p.&nbsp;390] Adding an attenuator on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img367.png"
 ALT="$OM_2$"></SPAN> leg--now called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reference beam</SPAN>--we could theoretically adjust for losses due to scattering. This will be necessary for the system to produce an interference pattern in the first place.

<P>
Keep in mind that for a wavelength <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img374.png"
 ALT="$\lambda=500$"></SPAN> nm, and a distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 ALT="$m_0$"></SPAN>, which corresponds to the number of fringes in the pattern, will be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img377.png"
 ALT="$400,000$"></SPAN>.
While interpreting the fringe pattern as a whole is something our eyes can do quickly, it is unreasonable to assume our detector would have the spatial resolution or frame rate necessary to do this in real time. Furthermore, it isn't necessary, as long as we decide to look at the velocity instead. 

<P>
A typical interferometer only has a single photodetector, or at most an array. A single photodetector can be used to count the number of fringes that pass over a single point, and would be able to detect the magnitude of the velocity. In general, to detect the velocity while preserving the direction, a slightly different technique is used.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Baker1990">2</A>, p.&nbsp;241]

<P>
The cost of building such a device as a prototype is not very high. There are potentially some optical components that would need to be well made. In particular, the mirrors would have to be of good quality, and everything would have to be mounted with finely adjustable stands. However, to construct a housing for the device would be costly.

<P>
The field-readiness of the device, as described above, is fairly low. There are 8 minimum components, counting the reference attenuator (discussed but not shown), that would each require fully locking, adjustable supports. Furthermore, unless one added additional mirrors, the maximum distance that could be measured with the device is the length of the reference beam. Therefore an arm must be constructed to house it, etc.

<P>
The quality is limited by the devices inability to discern direction of motion. The device is clearly much better suited for displacement measurements. If the fringe patterns could be analyzed more directly, it could be made to track direction, but that would necessitate a loss in frame rate, field readiness, and an increase in cost.

<P>
The device is fairly general. It can measure vibrations even on rough surfaces by calibrating the reference beam.

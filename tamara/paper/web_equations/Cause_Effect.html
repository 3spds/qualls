Cause and Effect</A>
</H1>
 Lucier's natural intelligence cannot be properly interpreted by human intelligence. In order to gain an understanding of it we must contemplate it directly, without bias. When the aspect of nature Lucier wants to frame cannot be directly perceived, technology must serve as a mediator. Categorically a product of human intelligence, however, technology can only translate natural intelligence if it is unbiased. 

<P>
Therefore, Lucier frequently makes the claim that the tools employed in his early compositions are intended to be prosthetics of the sensory organs, and not musical instruments: ``Acoustical test equipment is, by its very nature, free of content. What goes into a material or environment to be tested must be neutral so that the results are unbiased.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;456] The activities permitted by this method of knowing must fall short of aesthetic interpretation in order to be acceptable. He describes the appropriate examples of contemplation of the natural as ``testing, probing, exploring.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;440] In a word: measurement.

<P>
The word ``measurement,'' in this context, does not precisely connote other possible uses of the term. E.g, measurement does not mean the same thing to Lucier as it did to Cage. Lucier makes this very clear in the accounts of his own work and that of his colleague's. According to Lucier, and to Cage himself, Cage's work often uses measurement as a means to construct the experience of acausality. As a result, the Cagean measurement typically quantifies its results, so they can be made illegible through incongruous translation. 

<P>
By contrast, the measurements permitted by Lucier's early compositions are frequently qualitative, and more concerned with observation: ``My pieces are cause and effect whereas Cage's are not. ... I don't get in the middle and destroy the relationship.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;230] Perhaps this explains why, for example, Lucier never specifies numerical measurements for "Music on a Long Thin Wire." Because his object is the natural intelligence latent in the physical system, with all its particular eccentricities, Lucier's early work privileges certain forms of measurement over others. This is because Lucier was playing with the notion of the legitimacy of scientific modes of observation. His early compositions seem to propose that the forms of measurement afforded by scientific observation alone are sufficient to achieve transcendence. To ``get in the middle'' would suggest that one is no longer observing the system in its natural state. 

<P>
Tellingly, Lucier describes the process of arriving at ``Vespers'' as a process of looking outside.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.84] At this point in his aesthetic development, the measurement of the natural world provides him a way to escape his own expectations. The exploration of space in the context of  ``Vespers'' brings us into a direct experience of the life of a space. Furthermore, ``Vespers'' brings its performers a state where they must contend with the task of being so restricted. As a composition, the piece is typical for the way Lucier's early works use measurement- there is no guide, no organizing principle, not even a singular <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ending</SPAN>. 

<P>
The role of science in our culture seems to have changed in the last few decades. Bruno Latour puts it succinctly: "Scientists no longer appear as a voice from nowhere mysteriously fused with the undisputable[sic] necessity of matters of facts." [<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Latour2011">20</A>] These days, many of us have come to accept that science is no longer apolitical, if it ever had been in the first place. Underscoring the assumption of the neutrality of scientific measurement is the commonly excepted belief that we, who have developed cities, are modern, and therefore removed from nature entirely. Of course, this has never been the case.

<P>
Later in his career, Lucier would move away from signifiers of science as a method for legitimizing his characteristic exploratory measurements. Since the 80's, his work has become more indicative of a deep appreciation for the Western Tradition. This reconciliation could only come about because of the process he went through in the 70's, of turning away from his "Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms,"[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;1] to develop a separate narrative, populated with characters who, in all likelihood, all sell insurance for a living.

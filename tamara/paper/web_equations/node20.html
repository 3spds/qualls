Self-Mixing LDV</A>
</H2>
 An especially attractive variant on the Laser Doppler Vibrometer, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Self-Mixing</SPAN> LDV, uses the laser cavity itself as the location of beam mixing. Therefore, no external mirrors are required. This technique strongly suggests the use of a diode laser, although it has been attempted in tube lasers as well.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Giuliani2003">12</A>] Modern laser diodes frequently have a second pair of pins, which connect to the embedded photosensitive element. 
While the self-mixing approach seems to work without any accoutrements besides the laser diode and an attenuator, the dynamic range in this configuration is poor. Thus, much of the research contributing to the design of these devices is dedicated to improving them in this respect. 
Since this technique has been established for some time, some fairly sophisticated implementations exist in the literature. This technique looks very promising on all fronts.

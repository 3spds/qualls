Laser Doppler Vibrometry</A>
</H2>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Laser Doppler Vibrometry</SPAN> is an attempt to solve some of the drawbacks concomitant with Michelson or other standard interferometry methods, most importantly the sign ambiguity. [<A
 HREF="node33.html#Giuliani2003">12</A>]
 This is typically accomplished in one of two ways. The first method is to use polarization to read instantaneous velocity in quadrature. The second is to frequency shift the reference beam by a constant value prior to mixing the beams back together.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Giuliani2003">12</A>]
 Since the first method is essentially just a doubling of the interferometer approach, we shall focus on the operation of the second method. The frequency shifting is performed by an acousto-optic modulator, typically a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Bragg cell</SPAN>. Such devices are ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers which are transparent and capable of modulating their indeces of refraction at sufficiently high frequencies to shift the color of the light by a few tens of Mhz. This is applied to the reference beam in order to produce fringe patterns that move at a constant velocity when the surface is at rest. This way, a change in the displacement in the negative direction corresponds to a negative acceleration in the fringe pattern. The bandwidth is then limited by how far down the Bragg cell can shift the reference beam frequency.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Baker1990">2</A>, p.&nbsp;241]

<P>
Either method is guaranteed to cost a lot more, even to prototype. The quadrature method doubles the cost of the prototype, and will also increase the cost of a field version considerably. The frequency shift method requires the use of a Bragg cell, which is expensive.

<P>
As for their field-readiness, the added bulk of the quadrature method is unreasonable. Furthermore, it poses even more problems related to calibration. The frequency shift method seems to be a better choice for field work out of the two. Bragg cells are not very big, and therefore portability is not any more hindered than the case of the interferometer.

<P>
For the quadrature method the quality is likely very good. For the frequency shift method, the quality depends on the Bragg cell, but it will be optically band-limited, due to the heterodyning process.

<P>
There are many variants that have been suggested on this general idea. C.f. [<A

 HREF="node33.html#Baker1990">2</A>], and [<A

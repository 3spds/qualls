Nature</A>
</H1>
If we momentarily set aside some of his more psychologically-driven entries, Lucier's early work is often positioned as an encounter with the natural: the physical, the causal, the salient. Nature, in this sense, is not limited to the domain of the pastoral landscape, but the lattice of observable facts, presented in a simple, understated tone of voice, from the reference frame of the individual. 

<P>
Furthermore, many of these compositions seem to appropriate imagery from nineteenth-century <SPAN  CLASS="textit">naturphilosophie</SPAN> and transcendentalism. This imagery appears in the form of his text-score instructions to the performers as well as the theatrical spectacle they present to the audience. Lucier's methods, language, and imagery appear to stem from an appeal to the natural as a solution to the aesthetic contradictions set in place by modernity. 

<P>
Frequently, the enlisted performer must participate in an action of embodied measurement. Located within the already loaded space of the concert hall, these measurements function in a manner similar to virtuosic instrumental performance, in that successfully completing such an action requires the performer to commit unflinchingly to a theatrical situation, and this commitment invites the audience to observe the process as it unfolds. However, the actions completed on stage often lie outside the canonical domain of musical production. This practice of recontextualizing the non-musical, which is not uncommon in the music of the American experimental movement, might be succinctly described as &#226;&#128;&#156;reframing.&#226;&#128;&#157;[<A
 HREF="node33.html#dewar2012">8</A>] By encouraging performers and audience members to relate to nature through the task of measurement, he presents nature as a basis of facts: shared, absolute, and direct. 

<P>
In the years following World-War II, a common characteristic within the subculture of the American experimental movement was a hunger for the inception of an identity separate from Europe. Lucier was no exception to this. In the opening lines of his book, <SPAN ID="txt1552">Music 109</SPAN>, he writes: "When I went to college we studied the masterpieces of European music... one felt one's spiritual home was in Europe...We all had inferiority complexes." [<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;1]

<P>
In its polemical form, this identity crisis manifested itself as a criticism of indulgent self-expression in Europe. Each composer in this group offers unique strategies for navigating this. For example, Lucier explains Cage's method of indeterminacy as a solution: ``Indeterminacy gets personal preference out of the compositional process. Isn't that a shocking idea? Weren't we always taught that art was about self-expression?''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;11] He similarly praises Christian Wolff's solution through interaction and contingency.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;46] Likewise, early Lucier relinquishes composerly control in a different way from either of these colleagues. Lucier's solution was to supplant his own conscious intelligence with the intelligence of nature. 

<P>
Although he might use less sentimental vocabulary to describe it, the idea of a natural intelligence is central to the construction of nature in Lucier's early work. He expresses an affinity for this concept in several ways. Perhaps most obvious is his devotion to his self-ascribed role as a documentarian of this intelligence. Many of Lucier's compositions from this period seem to consist of the unadorned presentation of a physical or biological principle. 

<P>
According to Lucier, this is the best method of contemplating the natural, and learning whatever it has to offer: ``I don't bring an idea of mine about composition into a space and superimpose it on that space, I just bring a very simple idea about a task that players can do and let the space push the players around. In that way, I always learn something about a space...''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;78] In the interview from which the above quote was taken, Lucier was talking about <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vespers</SPAN>, a piece that involves sound in spaces, but one could easily imagine him saying something analogous about any of the processes his early pieces explore. Thus, space is simultaneously granted agency and intelligence.

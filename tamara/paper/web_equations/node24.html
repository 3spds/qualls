 Lucier is very fond of reminding his students that Ives sold insurance for a living. In fact, this characterization of Ives makes up the first chapter in his recent book. Ives, in Lucier's worldview, is an American solution to the problem of high Modernism, as posed by the European avant-garde.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;3] It is not difficult to imagine that Lucier might feel a kindred sort of bond, or perhaps even a line of descent. The protagonist, in Lucier's implied narrative, is not a hero, or a virtuoso, or a technician. This person is no ``courtly muse,'' to quote Emerson, via Lucier. In fact, he just might be an insurance salesman.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;3]

An unpretentious earnestness pervades the imagery of his often vividly visual compositions. As Tenney notes in the aforementioned piece, ```plain' and `poetic' are not necessarily mutually exclusive qualities.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;16] As a result, his compositions are simple, but not sleek. This is by design: foremost in Lucier's value system is an integral devotion to the process. He is paying Cage a rather high compliment when he says: ``he's extremely meticulous with his scores. He doesn't cheat, either.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;11]

Like many artists in his camp, he constantly renegotiates a balance between the desire to polish his work and the desire to allow the process to unfold on its own. For Lucier, the distinction is simultaneously one of aesthetics and one of ethics. Speaking about a recording of ``Music on a Long Thin Wire,'' where he grappled with his instinctive desire to edit, he relates: ``I said to myself, `Don't cheat. You said you wouldn't cheat. The listener may not know you cheated, but you'll know.'''[<A

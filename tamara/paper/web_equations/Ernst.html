Ernst
</H1>
 It was not until 1786, four years after his father died, that Chladni began lecturing on acoustics. He had spent those four years tackling open problems in the field: "...I performed experiments on transversal [sic] vibrations of rods, which had been the subject of theoretical studies of Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli, and then on the vibrations of plates, which were an unknown field."[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;27] Chladni had also begun building novel instruments, largely inspired by the glass harmonica, which he had read about in a publication by Nicolaus Forkel. This also convinced him to use a bow to excite the resonances in his objects, rather than merely exciting them with tapping.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;27]

<P>
He had also read about the experiments of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who in 1777 had become famous for his experiments with electricity. Lichtenberg created strikingly beautiful, spidery figures by sprinkling various powders onto dielectric plates and applying current into them. When Chladni attempted this, however, an entirely different sort of pattern emerged. These would come to bear his name.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;27]

<P>
Chladni meticulously documented and cataloged the patterns he found. For his first book, published in 1787, he included drawings of the patterns which emerged on each of the 11 plates he investigated. There were 166 of these figures total. This book, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">``Entdeckungen uber die Theorie des Klanges''</SPAN>, provided empirical evidence which conflicted with Euler and Golovin's mathematical models of rigid plates. At the end of the book, he reiterated the open mathematical questions concomitant with constructing a new model.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;27]

<P>
Meanwhile, Chladni had effectively run out of money. His infrequent, part-time status as a guest lecturer barely made the man enough to support himself.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;27] He decided to go on tour. He recalls, 
``It occurred to me that an artist who knows how to give himself some publicity is less attached to a certain place and has more opportunities of being received kindly and profiting nearly everywhere than a scholar dedicated to the academic life, and I hoped to succeed likewise, not by means of virtuosity, because I had so late in life begun to learn music, but due to the invention of a new instrument.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Stockmann2007">30</A>, p.&nbsp;17]

<P>
From 1792 - 1812 he traveled Europe, giving demonstrations of his findings.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Stockmann2007">30</A>, p.&nbsp;21] Early in his travels he met Lichtenberg, and their interaction sparked his interest in meteors, which, much later in life, would become the topic of his second contribution to the scientific community.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;28] It is clear from his remarks that Chladni situated his findings as similar to, but distinct from, musical virtuosity. He invented two novel musical instruments, both of which failed to capture the public imagination nearly as effectively as his plate demonstrations. Because of the physical immediacy and synaesthetic spectacle of his demonstrations, Chladni was able to present his lectures in a way that appealed to wealthy, powerful people all across Europe. 

<P>
Although he was content not to speculate beyond the results of his observations, this could not prevent others from speculating for him.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Bonds2012">4</A>, p.&nbsp;13] The possibility that nature could provide the basis for ideas surrounding musical and visual beauty especially resonated with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Naturphilosophen</SPAN> in Germany, and later the Transcendentalists in America.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Bonds2012">4</A>, p.&nbsp;15] Goethe, for example, initially paints him as pragmatic to a fault. In a letter to Schiller dated 1803, Goethe writes: 

<P>
``[Chladni] belongs to... those blissful persons who have not the faintest idea that there is something as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">naturphilosophie</SPAN> and who are only attentively trying to observe phenomena, which they will then classify and make use of...''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Stockmann2007">30</A>, p.&nbsp;18]

<P>
In other words, Chladni seemed a lot like an insurance salesman.

<P>
Goethe later recognized similarities between the patterns Chladni found and other patterns in nature, in particular, Johann Seebeck's work with polarized light. Goethe believed this to be proof that there was an underlying principle connecting the two phenomena, and, by extension, all phenomena.[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Bonds2012">4</A>, p.&nbsp;17] Later, perhaps once Chladni's contributions in other areas of inquiry became evident, Goethe would praise Chladni: ``...an ingenious man feels the impetus to study two natural phenomena which are far away from each other, and investigates both of them continuously.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Ullmann2007">32</A>, p.&nbsp;31]

<P>
Word of Chladni's experiments also had a profound effect on Ralph Waldo Emerson, who believed the symmetrical, undulating patterns he had found represented a portal to the supernatural. As such, Chladni's plates proved that an experience of the transcendent could be achieved through music: ``Orpheus, then, is no fable: Sing, and the rocks will crystallize; Sing, and the plants will organize.''[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Bonds2012">4</A>, p.&nbsp;15]

<P>
Furthermore, it is reasonable to believe there are certain themes--regardless of their veracity--in the story of Chladni that must have made him especially heroic to some. He was essentially a self-made man, who not only worked outside of the accepted realm of a natural scientist, but thrived there. 

<P>
Finally, we can approach the puzzling case of Dr. Hans Jenny. It is difficult to find anything of credible substance on the man. Perhaps this fact speaks more to the chauvinism of the academy--the author included--than anything else: Jenny certainly seems to have a lot of supporters, and not very many biographers. His own books are readily available, however, and the two volumes of <SPAN ID="txt1589">Cymatics</SPAN> paint a rather bizarre picture.

<P>
``However natural these things may seem, they are.[sic] in fact,
 not. It must be realized that this periodicity represents an aspect of the world, and at first its mysteriousness always inspires a feeling of the greatest astonishment.'' [<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#Jenny2001">16</A>, p.&nbsp;16]

<P>
The book's eponymous thesis states, roughly, that the entire world is made up of waves, having momentarily paused a torrent of terms related to cellular tissue and organs and organelles. The book itself is a collection of masterfully taken photographs of phantasmagoria, in the illustration of the vast interconnected system of universal principles. He makes enormous lists of only somewhat categorized phenomena, using contrast between the items to convey the breadth of his theories. He is almost always pictured surrounded with scientific equipment.

 Some scholars have noted that Alvin Lucier's musical ideas occasionally revolve around images, rather than sounds.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#kuivila2012">19</A>]This use of the word connotes less a reliance on sight, per se, than situations: Lucier immediately references the image of the whistler station at the opening of <SPAN ID="txt1535">Gravity's Rainbow</SPAN>, for example, in reminiscing about the inspiration for ``Sferics.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;151] His early text-scores, too, are saturated with visual and narrative imagery: for example, the notation for ``The Queen of the South,'' is about as visually overstimulating as any of Pynchon's scenery-filled, high-speed, run-on sentences.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, 350-352] James Tenney astutely points out the Whitmanesque quality shared by much of this text.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;16]

<P>
In response, Lucier denies any frivolity: ``I'm trying to write clear linear prose that describes a complete situation, that has balance''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;16] This does not come as a surprise. Lucier, like many in his generation within the American experimental school, values clear communication over florid embellishments, perhaps in reaction to perceived tendencies concomitant with the European avant-garde. A common signifier of belonging to this subculture, at least for Lucier's generation, is to minimize grandiose self-expression. In an interview, Lucier explains the function of the text-score further, but noticeably absent is any mention of the imagery embedded into those instructions.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;138]

<P>
Rather than locating the statements and endeavors of these artists within the context that evoked them, it may be tempting to claim that Lucier actually succeeded in erasing cultural reference from his music altogether. This claim revolves around Lucier's preoccupation with scientific and natural processes.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#yang2012">34</A>] However, to claim this would require that we ignore exactly those things which make his work unique. The fact that Lucier himself occasionally corroborates this hypothesis with statements about his own work indicates more clearly the cultural narrative that envelopes him. It does not give this claim any sort of veracity in the historiographical sense of the word: by attempting to remove cultural specificity from his work, he is actively navigating a particular cultural dialog. 

<P>
Lucier cannot help but be a great writer. His early pieces are overflowing with coherent, beautifully executed imagery, which strongly imply elements of his own character. The question, then, should not be whether Lucier's work participates in a system of signification, but rather, what is that system? It seems reasonable, given his propensity for storytelling, to derive the answer from the sorts of stories he tells. In so doing, one must be careful to locate the elements which make up the story. That is, to answer any sort of question about the man's work will require an analysis of how he positions himself--the protagonist of his own narrative--in relation to others. It will be especially illuminating to highlight the network of experiences and exchanges that have influenced him, either positively or negatively. 

<P>
This is not done in a glib attempt to stand beyond history and scoff at the failed pursuits of those who came before. On the contrary, this is intended as a nod to the man whose music, stories, and example truly inspired the author. Foucault writes, in the affected voice of the historian: "No past is greater than your present, and, through my meticulous erudition, I will rid you of your infatuations and transform the grandeur of history into pettiness, evil, and misfortune,"[<A
 HREF="node33.html#Foucalt1984">11</A>, p.&nbsp;91] meaning to point out the shameless astigmatism such whig analyses offer. An honest account of Lucier's work--and the least insulting--must (without grovelling!) take into account the complex system of influences and reactions that are the food of the artist. In short, what was Lucier eating, and how did it find expression in his work?

<P>
To offer a complete answer to this question is, of course, impossible. Furthermore, it is a bit misguided. Instead, the author will attempt to unpack a small subset of themes, to which a small subset of Lucier's output relates. Care will be taken not to assume either opposing birds-eye-views of the polemicist or the sycophant. Care will also be taken to step back and recall that the pieces described herein represent contingent moments in the development of an artist who is still active. Some of these themes come from work Lucier made thirty years ago. Therefore the perspective I take will be dusty, limited, and subtle. 

<P>

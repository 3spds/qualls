Vespers (1968)</A>
</H2>

<P>
The text-score for ``Vespers'' includes a brief homage to ``...all living creatures who inhabit dark places and who, over the years, have developed acuity in the art of echolocation.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;312] In particular, he is referring to the common North American bat.[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier2012">22</A>, p.&nbsp;86] 

<P>
The piece first calls for players to blind themselves, either with blindfolds or sunglasses, or by performing in the dark. Lucier delineates that the performers should use specialized clicking devices, called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Sondols</SPAN>, which were constructed by an acquaintance of his. These devices were designed to allow humans to communicate with dolphins.

<P>
He goes on to ask the performer to ``accept and perform the task of acoustic orientation by scanning the environment and monitoring the changing relationships between the outgoing and returning clicks.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.312] His description of the piece is largely pragmatic, but towards the end he includes a few lines of simple, evocative, prose:
``Dive with whales, fly with certain nocturnal birds or bats... or seek the help of other experts in the art of echolocation.''[<A
 HREF="node33.html#lucier1995">21</A>, p.&nbsp;314]

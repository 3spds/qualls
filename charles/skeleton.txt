I)	Lucier - imagery dealing with nature
	a)	eg – animal communication, acoustics, landscapes, biology
	b)	these images serve to produce a spectacle
	c)	frequently the performer must participate in embodied measurement
	d)	locating Lucier's work in the context of post-war American experimental music
	e) 	a cursory description of the pieces to be analyzed
		1)	Vespers (1968)
		2)	Queen of the South (1972)
		3)	Bird and Person Dyning (1975)
II)	Nature
	a)	latour / foucault / helmreich
		1)	politicians have used the naturalist interpretation of science for legitimacy
			i) 	naturalism uproots the results of science and expands them into world
			ii)	seeks to unify scientific lab practices into a continuous domain
			iii)	supports a whig search for “origin”
		2) 	naturalism as coming from the myth that the West was modern
			i)	“occidentalism”
			ii)	tendency to separate form from medium
		3)	the reality: recent developments have made us more dependent
		4)	universality / naturalisation of laws is not 'wrong,' necessarily
		5)	scientists are no longer decoupled from their institutions
			i)	messy inner workings, mistakes
			ii)	sacrifice of subject of knowledge
			iii)	life / nature : given → contingent
	b)	bonds - “absolute music”
			1)	naturphilosophie – nature is given, immutable, complete
			2) 	Hanslick - beauty has a natural basis in form
				i)	a veiled appeal to the Absolute in musical beauty
				ii)	absolute: free from representation
			3)	Hanslick refuses to accept n.p.'s reliance on metaphysics
				i)	instead, he describes music as free from representation
				ii)	and then defers to nature as source of universal laws
					a)	Beauty could be explained by nature
					b)	musical beauty reflects all of beauty
					c)	because natural phenomena reflect nature as a whole
					d)	“motion”
III) 	a historical treatment of ernst chladni's discoveries in acoustics
	a) a short bio
	b) how chladni situated his findings
		1)	functioning similar to, but distinct from, musical virtuosity
		2)	demonstrations- allowed him to travel
		3)	appears more concerned with applications than theory
			i)	his inventions meant more to him than sweeping statements
			ii)	however, the spectacle his inventions produced incited others to make 					
				sweeping statements of their own
	c) encounter with goethe & subsequent interpretation of chladni's laws
		1)	Orsted links laws of nature → musical beauty
			i)	therefore musical beauty is eternal
				a)	Hanslick misrepresents Orsted in his assessment
				b)	despite the fact that his conclusion is essentially Orsted's
			ii)	Orsted cites Chladni figures as evidence of this
		2)	many natural philosophers do this
			i)	goethe, nageli, schelling
	d) chladni's encounters with napoleon
		1)	offers chladni 6000 francs to publish Akustik in french
			i)	subsequent dedication to napoleon
			ii)	translation of “schall,” “klang,” and “ton”
		2)	offers a reward to the person who can explain the figures mathematically
			i)	deadline extended by 4 years
			ii)	finally partially solved by Sophie Germain
				a)	PDE correct, boundary conditions wrong
				b)	Gustav Robert Kirchoff solves it
		3)	makes the comment that the description of chladni patterns in more complex 				
			shapes could be useful in other domains
			i)	turns out he was right: equivalence between
				a)	stationary wave eq
				b)	helmholtz eq
				c)	schrodinger eq
			ii)	applications of irregular nodal patterns include
				a)	quantum chaos
				b)	optics
				c)	earthquakes
				d)	pattern formation in visual cortex
IV)	a historical treatment of Hans Jenny's Cymatics
	a) 	short bio
	b) 	appeals to scientific method 
	c) 	similarities with naturphilosophie
		1)	anthroposophy
	d)	"Cymatics" book released 1967
		1)	featured engaging visual display of wave phenomena
		2)	appeals to universal laws connecting disparate fields of study
		3)	emphasizes (without direct citation) that his work is empirical
		4)	makes sweeping statements about nature and beauty
V)	Analysis of language used in "Queen of the South"
	a)	direct references to Chladni & Jenny
	b)	appropriates alchemical imagery
	c)	performer's implied "character" could be allusion to scientific practices
	d)	what does this characterization impart to Lucier's "measurement" music?
		1)	an appeal to science as a solution to the contradictions of Modernism
		2)	similar to chladni, these presentations function like musical virtuosity
VI)	Supporting evidence from Vespers
VII)	Supporting evidence from Bird and Person Dyning
VIII)	Conclusion

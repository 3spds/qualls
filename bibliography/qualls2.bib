abstract = {Over the last ten years, face recognition has become a specialized applications area within the field of computer vision. Sophisticated commercial systems have been developed that achieve high recognition rates. Although elaborate, many of these systems include a subspace projection step and a nearest neighbor classifier. The goal of this paper is to rigorously compare two subspace projection techniques within the context of a baseline system on the face recognition task. The first technique is principal component analysis (PCA), a well-known baseline for projection techniques. The second technique is independent component analysis (ICA), a newer method that produces spatially localized and statistically independent basis vectors. Testing on the FERET data set (and using standard partitions), we find that, when a proper distance metric is used, PCA significantly outperforms ICA on a human face recognition task. This is contrary to previously published results.},

@article{Budisic2012,
abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

abstract = {We describe a sensitive and inexpensive vibrometer based on optical feedback by diffuse scattering to a single-mode diode laser. Fluctuations in the diode laser's operating frequency that are due to scattered light from a vibrating surface are used to detect the amplitude and frequency of surface vibrations. An additional physical vibration of the laser provides an absolute amplitude calibration. The fundamental bandwidth is determined by the laser response time of roughly 10(-9)s. A noise floor of 0.23 nm/Hz(1/2) at 30 kHz with 5 × 10(-5) of the incident light returning is demonstrated. This instrument provides an inexpensive and sensitive method of noncontact measurement in solid materials with low or uneven reflectivity. It can be used as a vibration or velocity sensor.},

@article{Vest1972,
abstract = {A full-field, variable sensitivity technique for mapping the vibrational amplitude of a diffuse surface is demonstrated. The surface under study is placed in an optical field consisting of two mutually coherent plane waves which propagate in different angular directions. At any instant of time the interference of these waves causes a fringe pattern to be formed on the surface under study. The time average, over one or more vibrational periods, of the intensity pattern on the surface can be obtained in real time by utilizing visual persistance or by making a time-average recording of an image of the surface. The visibility of the fringe pattern thus obtained is found to be modulated by a function of the local amplitude of vibration. This modulation can be observed directly or a photograph of the pattern can be optically processed to yield fringes that are loci of constant vibrational amplitude.},
